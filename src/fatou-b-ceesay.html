            I was born as Fatou B Ceesay in The Gambia, a small West African
            country. Growing up, I experienced both the joys and challenges of
            life in Africa. Despite facing bullies and enduring trauma, I never
            let it hinder my spirit. My family played a significant role in
            shaping who I am today, with my mother being a teacher and my father
            working for the government. I have four siblings, but sadly, I lost
            my oldest brother in January 2022. As a single mother to my
            beautiful daughter, Maya Elizabeth Joslin, I am dedicated to
            providing her with the best life possible.

            My educational journey began in The Gambia, where I attended Ndows
            Comprehensive School before transferring to Gambia High School,
            where I completed my high school degree. I was particularly drawn to
            the home economics course, perhaps because my mother was a teacher
            in that field. Education has always been important to me, and it has
            laid the foundation for my future endeavors.

            After moving to the United States at the age of 17, I embarked on a
            career path focused on helping others. I started as an employment
            consultant for people with disabilities and later transitioned into
            a program manager role in residential services. Working with
            vulnerable adults became a source of inspiration and personal
            growth. However, my heart always yearned for entrepreneurship, and I
            took a leap of faith by opening a salon in Michigan. Hair has always
            been a passion of mine, and it was fulfilling to express my
            creativity in that field. But my entrepreneurial spirit didn't stop
            there.

            When I became a mother, I realized the importance of representation
            and identity for children. That's when I created Femme Noir dolls, a
            doll line that empowers black kids worldwide. Recognizing the need
            for inclusive cleaning services, I launched a cleaning business in
            Seattle, Washington, which quickly gained momentum. In November
            2022, I expanded my entrepreneurial endeavors by opening a laundry
            mart in The Gambia. And in June 2023, I launched an all-kids salon,
            further adding to my repertoire of businesses.

            Throughout my journey, I have learned valuable lessons that I would
            like to share with others. Firstly, I've come to understand that the
            people we surround ourselves with greatly influence our growth. As
            we evolve, some individuals may naturally fall away, making room for
            new, like-minded individuals to enter our lives. Secondly, I've
            realized the importance of perseverance in the face of adversity.
            Life is full of challenges, but it is our ability to rise above them
            that defines our character. Lastly, I've come to embrace the power
            of self-belief and the strength that lies within. When we believe in
            ourselves, our dreams become attainable, and our potential knows no
            bounds.

            individual who defied odds, pursued passions, and became an
            inspiration to others. From my humble beginnings in The Gambia to
            expanding my ventures across borders, my journey has been one of
            growth, self-discovery, and unwavering determination. As I continue
            to chart my path, I am excited to see what the future holds and the
            impact I can make on the world around me.
